### 2. TERN Quick Haul (tern-quick-haul.jpg)
**Where to find**:

- Or use one of your existing TERN images if you have more

### 3. Lifestyle Images

#### Family Commute (family-commute.jpg)
**Where to find**:

2. **Rename them** to match the exact file names above
3. **Copy to images folder**:
   ```bash
   # Open Finder and drag images to:
   /Users/evan/Documents/Cursor - Project 1/images/
   ```
4. **Commit and push**:

   ```

## 💡 Pro Tip

If you have the family cargo bike image you showed earlier:
- Save it as `hero-bike.jpg` for the hero section
- Or save it as `family-commute.jpg` for the lifestyle section
- You can use the same image for both if needed (just copy it twice with different names)
