# Real Job Data Setup Guide

You're correct - we need **real job data with actual URLs**. Here's exactly what you need to get legitimate job postings:

## 🎯 **Best Options for Real Job Data**

### **1. SerpAPI** ⭐ (RECOMMENDED)
**What it provides**: Real Google Jobs results that include **actual LinkedIn job URLs**
**Setup needed**: Free account at https://serpapi.com/
**Cost**: Free tier (100 searches/month), then $50/month

**Steps to get real data:**
1. Go to https://serpapi.com/
2. Sign up for free account
3. Get your API key from dashboard
4. I'll update the code with your key

### **2. Indeed API** ⭐ 
**What it provides**: Official Indeed job postings with real URLs
**Setup needed**: Publisher account at https://ads.indeed.com/jobroll/xmlfeed
**Cost**: Free for personal use

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://ads.indeed.com/jobroll/xmlfeed
2. Register as a publisher
3. Get your Publisher ID
4. I'll update the code with your ID

### **3. Welcome to the Jungle**
**Issue**: Their API endpoint seems to have changed or requires authentication
**Solution**: Do you have a Welcome to the Jungle account? I can help find the right endpoint.

## 🚀 **What I Need From You**

To get **real jobs with actual URLs**, please let me know:

**Option A - SerpAPI (Recommended):**
- Sign up at https://serpapi.com/
- Get your API key
- I'll update the code to use real LinkedIn jobs from Google Jobs

**Option B - Indeed API:**
- Register at https://ads.indeed.com/jobroll/xmlfeed
- Get your Publisher ID
- I'll update the code for real Indeed jobs

**Option C - Multiple Sources:**
- If you can set up both, we'll get comprehensive real job data

## 🔧 **Current Status**

Right now the scraper is trying these APIs but needs proper authentication:
- ❌ SerpAPI: Needs API key (401 error)
- ❌ Indeed: Needs Publisher ID (connection error)
- ❌ Welcome to the Jungle: API endpoint not accessible
- ❌ Adzuna: Needs API credentials (401 error)

## ✅ **Next Steps**

1. **Pick one service** (I recommend SerpAPI for LinkedIn jobs)
2. **Get the API credentials** 
3. **Share them with me** (I'll update the code securely)
4. **Test with real data** immediately

Once you have the credentials, I can update the code and we'll get real hardware manager jobs in NY with actual URLs!

**Which service would you like to set up first?**
